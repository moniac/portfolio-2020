Having recently made a `.map` guide, it makes sense to make one for `.filter` as well.

## What is .filter?

`.filter` is an array method that receives an condition to compare all the items in
an array. If the condition passes, it will return that item to an array.

## The old way

Let's say we want to return all the values that are higher than 4. How would we do that
without using `.filter`? To give an idea, I made up an example that does this.

```
const arr = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32];
const arrayToFill = [];

arr.forEach(num => (num > 4 ? arrayToFill.push(num) : undefined));
```

Or even more verbose would be:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32];
const arrayToFill = [];

for (let index = 0; index < arr.length; index++) {
  const element = arr[index];

  if (element > 4) {
    arrayToFill.push(element);
  }
}
```

## Using .filter

Let's look at the example below.

```js {2}
const arr = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32];
const arrayToFill = arr.filter(num => num > 4);
```

Does it look weird to you? All I told the code to check for is if the current number is higher than 4. That's because all `.filter` cares for if the condition on the current number is true. True means it gets passed to the array, false means discard.

## Other usecases

You could also use `.filter` to filter through an array of objects.

```jsx react-live
() => {
  const arr = [
    { name: 'Mo', age: 26 },
    { name: 'Ann', age: 29 },
    { name: 'John', age: 42 },
    { name: 'Sarah', age: 22 },
  ];
  const olderThanTwentySix = arr.filter(person => person.age > 26);

  return (
    <ul>
      {olderThanTwentySix.map(person => (
        <li>{person.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
```
